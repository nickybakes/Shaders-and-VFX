# Shaders-and-VFX
Along with developing games and doing game art, I also write shaders and do VFX. I can do this for Unity, Unreal, and Godot, as shader language and material creation is basically universal to all engines.


Steel Heel Jam
-
In this Unity game, I wrote the shaders and created all the effects used in game. This includes:
 - Character shaders, rigging, outline, and facial expression shaders
 - Lighting used in game
 - All particle effects
 - All UI elements

Item Box from Mario Kart (Fan Art)
-
Created in Godot, showcases multiple effects layered together to create the overall composition.

Hologram Shaders
-
Shaders I made for holograms in Godot, complete with scanlines and periodic glitchy effects. There are two versions: one for 3D figures like the globe in the video, and one for 2D signs. I used reference images of holograms from Star Wars and Blade Runner.
